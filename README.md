# SimpleEdit Editor
This is the editor for SimpleEdit! (Node.js 14.00 or higher required.)
Check out [the website](https://simpleedit.github.io "Visit the SimpleEdit website") for more info!

The fastest way to use SimpleEdit is the [web app](https://editor.simpleedit.repl.co "Visit the SimpleEdit web app"). No installation required.
If you still want to host the web app yourself, continue with the following steps:

## Set Up Node Server
### Step 1: Clone the Github Repo
#### The Terminal (Reccomended)
Run `git clone https://github.com/SimpleEdit/editor` in your terminal ([Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Download Git") is required).
After that run `cd editor` in your terminal.
#### Run On Repl.it
[Fork the Repl on Repl.it](https://repl.it/@WilliamHorning/editor#README.md "Fork to run the editor on Repl.it")
### Step 2: Install NPM packages
Run `npm install` in your terminal to install packages.
### Step 3: Start your server!
Run `npm start` to start your server on port 50000

## Enjoy!
SimpleEdit is not even in beta yet, so be patient!
NOTE: You only need to clone the repo or fork the repl once. To use it again, simply type `cd editor` again and type `npm start`.
