# Contributing

It looks like you're interested in contributing to SimpleEdit! It's very easy.

## Contributing to the web app

#### Step 1 - Requesting for access

Go [here](https://repl.it/@SimpleEdit/editor?view=1) and click "Request for access" to request for access.

#### Step 2 - Making your edits

Once you have access, make your edits to the repl [here](https://repl.it/@SimpleEdit/editor). 
#### Important:

Stop the repl before making any edits.

#### Step 3 - Let us know

Once you have finished editing, DO NOT restart the repl. Instead, send us an email or message again and we'll review your edits. You'll be told if they're accepted, in which case the repl will be restarted. If it's rejected, you'll be told why.

## Contributing to the local app

Contributing the the local app is simpler, since you don't need to request access for anything.

#### Step 1 - Forking the repo

Fork the editor repo [here](https://github.com/SimpleEdit/editor/fork). If you're part of one or more organisations, be sure to select your username.

#### Step 2 - Making your edits

Open the file you'd like to edit. For example, to edit a page, open the [`views`](https://github.com/SimpleEdit/editor/tree/main/views) folder, and then open the page you'd like to edit.

#### Step 3 - Committing and merging

Once you've made your edits, commit them with a short title and description. Now, create a new pull request. Select "Compare across forks" and set the "head repository" to your fork. Select "Create pull request".

If you provided info when you committed and only edited one file, your info will already be filled in and you can just select "Create pull request". If there isn't any info, just fill it in with some basic info about your edits and select "Create pull request".

That's it! Your edits will be reviewed, and you'll get notified if they're accepted or rejected.
